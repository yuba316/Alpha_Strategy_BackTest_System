# Alpha Strategy Back Test System
A general backtest system for alpha trading strategy

### Preface
In 2019, I worked as a quantitative research intern in an Alpha strategy team for 9 months. At that time, we developed and backtested our factors in a company-provided system. Since we were a new team, I got a good chance to fully get in touch with many details about the backtest system, including how to deal with suspended and delisted stocks and several factor-to-weight algorithms.
